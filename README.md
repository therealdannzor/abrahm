# Abrahm Chain
A blockchain in Rust created from scratch for educational purposes.

### Design
The ambition is to demonstrate the most fundamental components of a working blockchain, albeit with rudimentary functionality. The focus is to deliver a complete and working baseline rather than the most clever, novel, and performant one.

### Dependencies
The main ones are:
* [themis](https://www.cossacklabs.com/themis/) for encryption and secure message exchange
* [tokio](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio) for async and UDP networking
* [rocksdb](https://rocksdb.org/)
