# Abrahm Chain
A blockchain in Rust created from scratch for educational purposes.

### Design
The ambition is to demonstrate the most fundamental components of a working blockchain, albeit with rudimentary functionality. The focus is to deliver a complete and working baseline rather than the most clever, novel, and performant one.

### Dependencies
This project uses [themis](https://www.cossacklabs.com/themis/) for encryption and secure message exchange. Please see the install steps [here](https://docs.cossacklabs.com/themis/languages/rust/installation/).
